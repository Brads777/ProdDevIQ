description: "Autonomous agents are AI systems that can independently decompose goals, plan actions, execute tools, and self-correct without constant human guidance. The challenge isn't making them capable - it's making them reliable. Every extra decision multiplies failure probability.  This skill covers agent loops (ReAct, Plan-Execute), goal decomposition, reflection patterns, and production reliability. Key insight: compounding error rates kill autonomous agents. A 95% success rate per step drops to 60% b"
