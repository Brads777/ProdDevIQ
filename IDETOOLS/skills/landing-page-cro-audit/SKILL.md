# Landing Page CRO Audit Skill

This skill provides expert-level conversion rate optimization analysis for landing pages. It evaluates designs against proven CRO principles and provides specific, actionable recommendations with expected impact levels.

## When to Use This Skill

- Reviewing an existing landing page design (code, screenshot, or URL)
- Evaluating a new landing page before launch
- Getting specific conversion optimization suggestions
- Understanding why a page may have low conversion rates
- Prioritizing improvements by impact potential

## Audit Framework

Analyze the landing page across these **8 Critical Conversion Dimensions**:

### 1. FIRST IMPRESSION (0-8 Seconds Rule)
The average user decides within 8 seconds whether to stay or leave.

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] Is the value proposition crystal clear within 3 seconds?
- [ ] Does the headline answer "What's in it for me?"
- [ ] Is the page purpose immediately obvious?
- [ ] Does it pass the "squint test" (key elements visible when squinting)?
- [ ] Is there visual hierarchy guiding the eye?

**Red Flags:**
- Headline is about the company, not the customer
- Multiple competing focal points
- Key benefit buried below the fold
- Generic stock photos that don't reinforce the message
- Cluttered above-the-fold area

### 2. VALUE PROPOSITION CLARITY
The core promise must be compelling and differentiated.

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] Headline: Specific benefit, not feature list
- [ ] Subheadline: Supports and expands the headline
- [ ] Supporting copy: Addresses "so what?" and "why you?"
- [ ] Differentiation: Clear reason to choose THIS solution
- [ ] Specificity: Numbers, results, or concrete outcomes

**Scoring Rubric:**
- **Strong**: "Save 40+ hours/month on patient calls with AI that handles 95% of inquiries"
- **Weak**: "The best AI receptionist for your practice"
- **Terrible**: "Welcome to our company"

### 3. CALL-TO-ACTION (CTA) OPTIMIZATION
CTAs are the conversion mechanism—they must be irresistible.

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] **Visibility**: CTAs stand out with contrasting colors
- [ ] **Copy**: Action-oriented, benefit-focused (not "Submit")
- [ ] **Placement**: Above fold + repeated strategically
- [ ] **Size**: Large enough to tap on mobile, not overwhelming
- [ ] **Urgency**: Reason to act now (if appropriate)
- [ ] **Friction reduction**: What objections does CTA copy address?

**CTA Copy Hierarchy (Best to Worst):**
1. Benefit-focused: "Start Saving 40 Hours/Month"
2. Action-outcome: "Get My Free Analysis"
3. Simple action: "Start Free Trial"
4. Generic: "Sign Up" / "Learn More"
5. Terrible: "Submit" / "Click Here"

### 4. TRUST & CREDIBILITY SIGNALS
Visitors need proof before they commit.

**Trust Element Checklist:**
- [ ] **Social Proof**: Customer logos, testimonials, case studies
- [ ] **Specificity**: Numbers (e.g., "200+ practices", "4.9★ rating", "$2.1M saved")
- [ ] **Authority**: Press mentions, certifications, awards
- [ ] **Guarantees**: Money-back, free trial, no credit card
- [ ] **Security**: HIPAA compliance badges, SSL indicators
- [ ] **Transparency**: Pricing visible, no hidden fees messaging

**Placement Best Practices:**
- Testimonials near CTAs reduce conversion friction
- Logos in hero section build immediate credibility
- Security badges near form fields increase completion

### 5. FRICTION & ANXIETY REDUCTION
Every element of friction reduces conversions.

**Friction Points to Identify:**
- [ ] Form length (each field reduces completion ~10%)
- [ ] Required vs. optional fields clearly marked
- [ ] Error handling (inline, helpful, not aggressive)
- [ ] Page load speed (every second = 7% conversion drop)
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness issues
- [ ] Confusing navigation or too many options
- [ ] Unclear pricing or hidden costs

**Anxiety Reducers:**
- "No credit card required"
- "Cancel anytime"
- "Setup in under 15 minutes"
- "100% money-back guarantee"
- "Your data is protected by..."

### 6. VISUAL HIERARCHY & LAYOUT
Design should guide users toward conversion.

**Evaluate:**
- [ ] **F-pattern or Z-pattern** alignment for scanning
- [ ] **Whitespace**: Adequate breathing room around CTAs
- [ ] **Directional cues**: Eyes, arrows, or lines pointing to CTAs
- [ ] **Contrast**: CTAs pop against background
- [ ] **Consistency**: Color, font, and spacing patterns
- [ ] **Mobile-first**: Touch targets 44px+, readable without zoom

**Common Layout Problems:**
- CTAs that blend into the background
- Important information in sidebars (low attention)
- Too many visual elements competing for attention
- Walls of text without scannable formatting

### 7. COPY & MESSAGING
Words drive action—every word must earn its place.

**Copy Audit Checklist:**
- [ ] **Customer-centric**: "You" language vs. "We" language
- [ ] **Benefits over features**: Outcomes, not capabilities
- [ ] **Scannable**: Headers, bullets, short paragraphs
- [ ] **Objection handling**: Addresses common concerns
- [ ] **Emotional triggers**: Pain points, aspirations, fears
- [ ] **Specificity**: Concrete numbers and outcomes

**Power Words for Conversions:**
- Urgency: Now, Today, Limited, Instant
- Exclusivity: Premium, Exclusive, Members-only
- Value: Free, Bonus, Save, Guaranteed
- Ease: Simple, Quick, Easy, Effortless
- Results: Proven, Results, Transform, Unlock

### 8. PSYCHOLOGICAL TRIGGERS
Leverage cognitive biases ethically.

**Evaluate Usage Of:**
- [ ] **Scarcity**: Limited availability or time-sensitive offers
- [ ] **Social Proof**: "Join 10,000+ happy customers"
- [ ] **Authority**: Expert endorsements, certifications
- [ ] **Reciprocity**: Free value before asking for commitment
- [ ] **Loss Aversion**: "Don't miss out" / "Stop losing..."
- [ ] **Anchoring**: Show original price vs. current price

## A/B Testing Priorities

After audit, recommend tests in this priority order:
1. **Headline variations** (highest impact, easiest test)
2. **CTA copy and color** (quick wins)
3. **Social proof placement** (trust positioning)
4. **Form field reduction** (friction removal)
5. **Page layout changes** (larger effort, variable impact)

Remember: Test one element at a time, run tests to statistical significance, and document all learnings.
