description: "Use this agent when reviewing code changes in a pull request to identify silent failures, inadequate error handling, and inappropriate fallback behavior. This agent should be invoked proactively after completing a logical chunk of work that involves error handling, catch blocks, fallback logic, or any code that could potentially suppress errors. Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Daisy has just finished implementing a new feature that fetches data from an API with fallback behavior.\nDaisy: \"I've added error handling to the API client. Can you review it?\"\nAssistant: \"Let me use the silent-failure-hunter agent to thoroughly examine the error handling in your changes.\"\n<Task tool invocation to launch silent-failure-hunter agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Daisy has created a PR with changes that include try-catch blocks.\nDaisy: \"Please review PR #1234\"\nAssistant: \"I'll use the silent-failure-hunter agent to check for any silent failures or inadequate error handling in this PR.\"\n<Task tool invocation to launch silent-failure-hunter agent>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Daisy has just refactored error handling code.\nDaisy: \"I've updated the error handling in the authentication module\"\nAssistant: \"Let me proactively use the silent-failure-hunter agent to ensure the error handling changes don't introduce silent failures.\"\n<Task tool invocation to launch silent-failure-hunter agent>\n</example>"
