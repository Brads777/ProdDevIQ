# Phase 6: Research Synthesis

> **CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE**: This template provides a framework for compiling all research findings into a comprehensive, actionable document. Adapt the structure and sections below to fit your specific research domain and output requirements.

## How to Customize This Phase
- Adjust document structure based on your audience (academic paper, business report, policy brief, technical documentation)
- Modify section headings to match your field's conventions
- Scale detail level based on the intended use of the document
- Include domain-specific appendices or supplementary materials as needed

---

## Objective
Compile all research findings into a comprehensive, actionable research document. This final document should stand alone as a complete analysis that can be understood by someone unfamiliar with the research process.

## Requirements

### 6.1 Document Structure
The final synthesis should include:
1. Executive Summary
2. Problem/Question Analysis
3. Landscape Review
4. Proposed Approach
5. Feasibility Assessment
6. Differentiation & Positioning
7. Implementation Roadmap
8. Risk Assessment
9. Recommendations
10. Appendix (sources, detailed data)

### 6.2 Quality Criteria
- Clear, professional writing
- Evidence-backed claims
- Honest assessment of risks and limitations
- Actionable recommendations
- Complete citations and sources

## Validation Criteria

### PASS if:
- [ ] All previous phases passed
- [ ] Document follows the required structure
- [ ] All claims are supported by evidence
- [ ] Recommendations are specific and actionable
- [ ] Document can stand alone for a reader unfamiliar with the research

### FAIL if:
- [ ] Previous phases did not all pass
- [ ] Critical sections are missing or incomplete
- [ ] Claims lack supporting evidence
- [ ] Recommendations are vague or unrealistic

## Domain-Specific Output Formats

| Research Domain | Primary Format | Key Sections | Typical Length |
|-----------------|----------------|--------------|----------------|
| Academic | Research paper/proposal | Literature review, methodology, findings | 5,000-10,000 words |
| Market Research | Business report | Market analysis, recommendations | 10-30 pages |
| Scientific | Technical paper | Methods, results, discussion | 3,000-8,000 words |
| Business | Strategy document | Analysis, recommendations, roadmap | 10-20 pages |
| Policy | Policy brief | Problem, options, recommendation | 2-10 pages |

## Final Steps

1. Review all phase documents for consistency
2. Ensure no contradictions between sections
3. Verify all claims have supporting evidence or citations
4. Have someone unfamiliar with the research read for clarity
5. Copy final document to appropriate output location

## Tips for This Phase

1. Write for your audience - adjust tone and detail level appropriately
2. Lead with the most important findings and recommendations
3. Be honest about limitations and uncertainties
4. Make recommendations specific and actionable
5. Include enough context that the document can stand alone
