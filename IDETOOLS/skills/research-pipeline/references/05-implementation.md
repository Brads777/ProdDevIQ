# Phase 5: Implementation Path

> **CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE**: This template provides a framework for defining a concrete, realistic path from concept to execution. Adapt the questions and criteria below to fit your specific research domain.

## How to Customize This Phase
- Replace "MVP" with the appropriate term (pilot study, proof of concept, initial phase, prototype, minimum viable approach)
- Adjust development phases to fit your context (research phases, project stages, rollout plan)
- Modify resource requirements based on your field (funding, personnel, equipment, time, access)
- Scale validation strategy to match your domain's success criteria

---

## Objective
Define a concrete, realistic path from idea to implementation. Identify what an initial version would look like and what resources would be needed.

## Required Questions

### 5.1 Minimum Viable Approach
- What is the smallest version that delivers core value?
- What elements are absolutely essential for the initial version?
- What can be deferred to later phases?

### 5.2 Implementation Approach
- What would the main phases look like?
- What should be done first?
- What methods, tools, or approaches would be used?

### 5.3 Resource Requirements
- What skills, expertise, or capabilities are needed?
- What would this cost to execute? (Rough estimate)
- What timeline is realistic for the initial phase?

### 5.4 Validation Strategy
- How would you validate the approach with real stakeholders?
- What metrics or indicators would signal success?
- What would trigger a change in direction or abandonment?

### 5.5 Distribution & Adoption
- How would the target audience discover or access this?
- What is the strategy for gaining adoption or recognition?
- What partnerships or collaborations would help?

### 5.6 Risks & Mitigations
- What are the biggest non-feasibility risks?
- What assumptions need to be validated?
- What could cause this to fail?

## Validation Criteria

### PASS if:
- [ ] Initial scope is clearly defined and achievable
- [ ] Implementation path is realistic
- [ ] Required resources are attainable
- [ ] Validation strategy is concrete
- [ ] Path to adoption/distribution is plausible

### FAIL if:
- [ ] Initial scope is too large or vague
- [ ] No clear path to reaching the target audience
- [ ] Required resources are unrealistic
- [ ] No way to validate key assumptions
- [ ] Critical risks have no mitigation

```

## Implementation Principles

1. **Start small and focused** - Don't try to do everything at once
2. **Validate before scaling** - Test assumptions with real stakeholders
3. **Functional over polished** - Deliver value quickly, refine later
4. **Learn, don't just execute** - Every phase should test key assumptions
5. **Time-box ruthlessly** - Set deadlines and adjust scope to meet them

## Domain-Specific Implementation Approaches

| Research Domain | Initial Version | Key Milestones | Validation Method |
|-----------------|-----------------|----------------|-------------------|
| Academic | Pilot study, working paper | IRB approval, data collection, draft | Peer feedback, preliminary results |
| Market Research | Survey pilot, initial interviews | Sample recruited, data collected | Response quality, actionable insights |
| Scientific | Proof of concept, initial experiment | Method validated, initial results | Reproducibility, statistical significance |
| Business | Prototype, beta version | Working product, initial users | User engagement, feedback |
| Policy | Position paper, stakeholder consultation | Coalition built, proposal drafted | Stakeholder support, feasibility |

## Tips for This Phase

1. Identify the riskiest assumptions and design early phases to test them
2. Build in decision points where you evaluate whether to continue, pivot, or stop
3. Start with the audience most likely to adopt and expand from there
4. Plan for what you'll learn, not just what you'll produce
5. Be realistic about timelines - most projects take longer than initially estimated
