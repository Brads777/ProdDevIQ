description: "Inspect GitHub PR checks with gh, pull failing GitHub Actions logs, summarize failure context, then create a fix plan and implement after user approval. Use when a user asks to debug or fix failing PR CI/CD checks on GitHub Actions and wants a plan + code changes; for external checks (e.g., Buildkite), only report the details URL and mark them out of scope."
