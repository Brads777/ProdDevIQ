## Output Guidelines

- Preserve the author's voice unless asked to change it
- For corrections: show changes or provide clean version based on preference
- For analysis: provide actionable feedback, not just ratings
- Match formality level to context (academic vs. blog vs. email)

## Chaining Suggestions

- After `improve_writing` → offer `fix_typos` for final polish
- After `humanize` → offer `analyze_prose` to verify accessibility
