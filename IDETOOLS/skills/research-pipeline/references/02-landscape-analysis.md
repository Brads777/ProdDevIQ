# Phase 2: Landscape Analysis

> **CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE**: This template provides a framework for analyzing the existing landscape of knowledge, solutions, or approaches related to your research topic. Adapt the questions and criteria below to fit your specific research domain.

## How to Customize This Phase
- Replace "solutions" with the appropriate term (prior research, existing approaches, current practices, available options)
- Adjust competitor analysis to fit your context (related studies, alternative methods, competing theories)
- Modify research sources based on your field (databases, industry sources, expert networks)
- Scale gap analysis to match your domain's evaluation criteria

---

## Objective
Research and analyze all current knowledge, solutions, or approaches that address the problem identified in Phase 1. Understanding the landscape is critical before proposing something new.

## Required Questions

### 2.1 Direct Alternatives
- What existing solutions, approaches, or prior work directly addresses this problem?
- Who are the key players, researchers, or organizations in this space?
- What is the current state of knowledge or practice?

### 2.2 Indirect Approaches
- What workarounds or partial solutions do people currently use?
- What adjacent work or methods partially address this problem?
- Are there manual processes or informal practices that substitute for a formal solution?

### 2.3 Landscape Analysis
For each significant existing approach, document:
- Name and description
- Origin/creator (researcher, organization, etc.)
- Key characteristics or features
- Strengths
- Weaknesses/limitations
- Reception (citations, adoption, reviews)

### 2.4 Gap Analysis
- What do existing approaches fail to address?
- What common criticisms or limitations exist?
- What needs remain unmet?

### 2.5 Field Dynamics
- Is this field/market growing, stable, or declining in activity?
- Are there recent developments, entries, or shifts?
- What emerging trends might change the landscape?

## Validation Criteria

### PASS if:
- [ ] At least 3-5 existing approaches have been thoroughly analyzed
- [ ] Clear gaps in current knowledge or solutions are identified
- [ ] Limitations of existing approaches are documented
- [ ] There is room for a meaningfully different contribution

### FAIL if:
- [ ] No existing work found (may indicate problem is not recognized)
- [ ] Existing approaches fully address the problem
- [ ] Gaps identified are trivial or easily addressed by existing work
- [ ] Space is oversaturated with similar approaches

## Research Sources by Domain

| Research Domain | Primary Sources | Secondary Sources |
|-----------------|-----------------|-------------------|
| Academic | Google Scholar, arXiv, discipline databases | Conference proceedings, dissertations |
| Market Research | Industry reports, analyst coverage | Trade publications, news |
| Scientific | PubMed, discipline journals | Preprints, conference papers |
| Business | Market analysis, competitor websites | Customer reviews, case studies |
| Policy | Government reports, think tanks | News coverage, advocacy publications |
| General | Web search, expert interviews | Community forums, social media |

## Tips for This Phase

1. Cast a wide net initially, then narrow focus to most relevant alternatives
2. Look for both successful and failed approaches - failures teach lessons
3. Pay attention to why gaps exist (technical barriers, lack of interest, resource constraints)
4. Document the trajectory of the field, not just its current state
5. Consider perspectives from multiple stakeholder groups
