# Phase 1: Problem Definition

> **CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE**: This template provides a framework for defining and validating the core problem, question, or need your research addresses. Adapt the questions and criteria below to fit your specific research domain.

## How to Customize This Phase
- Replace "problem" with the appropriate term for your domain (research question, hypothesis, need, challenge, opportunity)
- Adjust "target audience" to fit your context (stakeholders, population, market segment, affected parties)
- Modify evidence sources based on your field (academic literature, industry reports, surveys, interviews)
- Scale severity assessment to match your domain's impact metrics

---

## Objective
Clearly articulate the problem, question, or need your research addresses. A well-defined problem is the foundation of valuable research.

## Required Questions

### 1.1 Problem Statement
- What specific problem, question, or need are you addressing?
- Who is affected by or interested in this? (Be specific about the target audience/stakeholders)
- In what context does this problem or question arise?

### 1.2 Significance Assessment
- How significant is this problem or question for those affected?
- What is the frequency or prevalence of this issue?
- What are the current approaches or workarounds being used?

### 1.3 Problem Validation
- How do you know this problem or question is worth addressing? (Evidence required)
- Are there existing discussions, literature, or documented cases about this?
- Have you or others directly observed or experienced this?

### 1.4 Problem Scope
- How many people, organizations, or entities are affected?
- Is this a growing or shrinking concern?
- What trends or factors are influencing this problem?

## Validation Criteria

### PASS if:
- [ ] Problem/question can be stated in 1-2 clear sentences
- [ ] Target audience or stakeholders are specifically identified
- [ ] Evidence exists that this is a real and recognized issue
- [ ] Significance justifies the research effort
- [ ] Scope is specific, not vague or overly broad

### FAIL if:
- [ ] Problem is hypothetical with no supporting evidence
- [ ] Problem is too vague to address concretely
- [ ] Target audience or stakeholders cannot be identified
- [ ] Significance is minimal (interesting but not important)
- [ ] Problem is already adequately addressed elsewhere

## Output Template

## Problem Definition Summary

**Problem Statement:** [1-2 sentence clear problem/question statement]

**Target Audience/Stakeholders:** [Specific description of who is affected or interested]

**Context:** [When/where this problem or question arises]

**Significance:** [High/Medium/Low with justification]

**Evidence:**
- [Source 1]
- [Source 2]
- [Source 3]

**Scope:** [Estimated scale of impact, growth trend]

**Phase 1 Result:** PASS / FAIL

**Notes:** [Any additional observations or refinements needed]
```

## Tips for This Phase

1. Avoid solution-first thinking - focus only on understanding the problem
2. Search for existing discussions, literature, or documentation about this issue
3. Look for patterns in how others describe or experience this problem
4. Consider if this is a symptom of a deeper underlying issue
5. Validate that the problem exists beyond your own perspective or assumptions

## Domain-Specific Adaptations
