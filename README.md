# GODMODEDEV

The ultimate Claude Code IDE setup framework. One command to go from zero to a fully-configured AI development environment with Docker containers, a curated skill library, multi-agent orchestration, and best-practice defaults.

## What This Is

GODMODEDEV is a bootstrap toolkit that sets up a complete Claude Code development environment including:

- **Docker-based dev containers** — isolated, reproducible environments with all tooling pre-installed
- **Skillpository** — registry of 489 installable items (350 skills + 139 agents) across 28 skill and 11 agent categories
- **Multi-agent orchestration** — unified orchestrator with 10 specialist agents, phase-gated workflows, and saga-pattern error handling
- **Project scaffolding** — `/init` a new project with level-appropriate phase gates (L0 quick fix through L4 enterprise)
- **Agent templates** — deployable `.claude/agents/` configs for coder, architect, reviewer, TDD, researcher, debugger, documenter, security auditor, and deploy runner
- **Context hygiene** — patterns that keep your main context clean over long sessions via smart delegation and batch sizing

## Quick Start

```bash
# 1. Clone and enter
git clone <repo-url> && cd GODMODEDEV

# 2. Start Docker environment (optional)
docker compose up -d

# 3. Open in Claude Code
claude

# 4. Initialize a project
/init

# 5. Deploy specialist agents
/agents-deploy
```
