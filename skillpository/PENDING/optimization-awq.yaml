description: "Activation-aware weight quantization for 4-bit LLM compression with 3x speedup and minimal accuracy loss. Use when deploying large models (7B-70B) on limited GPU memory, when you need faster inference than GPTQ with better accuracy preservation, or for instruction-tuned and multimodal models. MLSys 2024 Best Paper Award winner."
