# Phase 3: Feasibility Assessment

> **CUSTOMIZATION GUIDE**: This template provides a framework for assessing whether your proposed approach is feasible given current capabilities, resources, and constraints. Adapt the questions and criteria below to fit your specific research domain.

## How to Customize This Phase
- Replace "technical" with the appropriate feasibility type (operational, financial, methodological, practical)
- Adjust resource requirements to fit your context (funding, expertise, equipment, access, time)
- Modify risk categories based on your field (ethical, regulatory, logistical, technical)
- Scale complexity assessment to match your domain's constraints

---

## Objective
Assess whether your proposed approach is viable with current or near-future capabilities. Identify risks, requirements, and constraints that could affect success.

## Required Questions

### 3.1 Core Requirements
- What core capabilities, methods, or resources would this approach require?
- Do these capabilities exist and are they accessible?
- What is the current state-of-the-art for these requirements?

### 3.2 Approach Design
- What would the high-level approach or methodology look like?
- What are the main components or phases needed?
- How would these components work together?

### 3.3 Risk Identification
- What are the most challenging aspects of this approach?
- Are there any unsolved problems this depends on?
- What could go wrong?

### 3.4 Dependencies
- What external resources, partnerships, or access would be needed?
- What existing tools, methods, or frameworks are available?
- Are there any critical dependencies or single points of failure?

### 3.5 Scale & Constraints
- What are the key constraints (time, budget, access, expertise)?
- How would this approach scale if successful?
- Are there known limitations to address?

### 3.6 Build vs. Leverage
- What components could be developed from scratch?
- What should be sourced from existing work?
- What would require significant development or research?

## Validation Criteria

### PASS if:
- [ ] Core capabilities and methods exist and are accessible
- [ ] No fundamental unsolved problems blocking the approach
- [ ] Risks are identified and have mitigation paths
- [ ] Required dependencies are available and reliable
- [ ] Approach is feasible with reasonable resources

### FAIL if:
- [ ] Requires capabilities that don't exist yet
- [ ] Depends on solving hard unsolved problems
- [ ] Complexity far exceeds the value proposition
- [ ] Critical dependencies are unreliable or unavailable
- [ ] Would require unrealistic resources

## Feasibility Dimensions by Domain

| Research Domain | Primary Feasibility | Key Resources | Critical Risks |
|-----------------|---------------------|---------------|----------------|
| Academic | Methodological | Time, funding, data access | Validity, ethics approval |
| Market Research | Operational | Budget, sample access | Response rates, bias |
| Scientific | Technical/Ethical | Equipment, expertise, funding | Reproducibility, safety |
| Business | Financial/Operational | Capital, talent, time | Market timing, execution |
| Policy | Political/Practical | Stakeholder buy-in, data | Implementation, resistance |
| Engineering | Technical | Tools, expertise, materials | Performance, reliability |

## Tips for This Phase

1. Be honest about constraints - optimistic feasibility assessments lead to failed projects
2. Identify the riskiest assumptions and plan to test them early
3. Consider both "can we do this?" and "should we do this?"
4. Look for similar projects that succeeded or failed - learn from their experience
5. Plan for contingencies - what is your backup if key assumptions prove false?
