description: "Browser automation powers web testing, scraping, and AI agent interactions. The difference between a flaky script and a reliable system comes down to understanding selectors, waiting strategies, and anti-detection patterns.  This skill covers Playwright (recommended) and Puppeteer, with patterns for testing, scraping, and agentic browser control. Key insight: Playwright won the framework war.
