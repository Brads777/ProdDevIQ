Examples:\n\n<example>\nContext: Daisy has just created a pull request with new functionality.\nuser: \"I've created the PR. Can you check if the tests are thorough?\"\nassistant: \"I'll use the pr-test-analyzer agent to review the test coverage and identify any critical gaps.\"\n<commentary>\nSince Daisy is asking about test thoroughness in a PR, use the Task tool to launch the pr-test-analyzer agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: A pull request has been updated with new code changes.\nuser: \"The PR is ready for review - I added the new validation logic we discussed\"\nassistant: \"Let me analyze the PR to ensure the tests adequately cover the new validation logic and edge cases.\"\n<commentary>\nThe PR has new functionality that needs test coverage analysis, so use the pr-test-analyzer agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>\n\n<example>\nContext: Reviewing PR feedback before marking as ready.\nuser: \"Before I mark this PR as ready, can you double-check the test coverage?\"\nassistant: \"I'll use the pr-test-analyzer agent to thoroughly review the test coverage and identify any critical gaps before you mark it ready.\"\n<commentary>\nDaisy wants a final test coverage check before marking PR ready, use the pr-test-analyzer agent.\n</commentary>\n</example>"
