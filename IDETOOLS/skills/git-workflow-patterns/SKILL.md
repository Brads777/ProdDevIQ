# Git Workflow Patterns

Comprehensive git workflow patterns and code quality standards for team environments.

## Workflows

Detailed workflow guides are available in `references/`:

- **Branching**: See `references/branch.md` for branch naming conventions, strategies, and lifecycle management
- **Commits**: See `references/commit.md` for commit message formats, atomic commits, and conventional commits
- **Pull Requests**: See `references/pr.md` for PR creation, templates, review workflows, and merge strategies
- **Code Review**: See `references/code-review.md` for review checklists, feedback patterns, and approval flows
- **Worktrees**: See `references/worktrees.md` for parallel development with git worktrees

## Rules and Standards

Quality enforcement rules for different domains:

- **Backend Rules**: See `references/backend-rules.md` for server-side code standards
- **Frontend Guidelines**: See `references/frontend-guidelines.md` for client-side code standards
- **Pre-commit Checks**: See `references/pre-commit-checks.md` for automated checks before commits
- **Security Rules**: See `references/security-rules.md` for security-focused code review and standards
