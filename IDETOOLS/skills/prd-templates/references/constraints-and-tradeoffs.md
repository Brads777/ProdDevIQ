# Constraints and Tradeoffs

## Project Overview
Summarize the project scope and goals based on user input. Clarify the product's core purpose before proceeding.

## 1. Technical Constraints

### 1.1 Infrastructure
Ask the user about hosting preferences, cloud providers, and database needs. Document any existing infrastructure requirements.

### 1.2 Performance
Identify expected user load, acceptable response times, and scalability requirements. Clarify performance priorities with the user.

### 1.3 Security & Compliance
Determine regulatory requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.) and security standards. Ask about data sensitivity and authentication needs.

### 1.4 Integration
Document required third-party integrations and APIs. Ask the user about existing systems that must connect to this product.

## 2. Business Constraints

### 2.1 Timeline
Establish key milestones and deadlines. Ask when the user needs the product delivered and any critical dates.

### 2.2 Resources
Identify who will maintain the product post-launch. Clarify if the user has technical staff or needs fully autonomous operation.

### 2.3 Budget
Document spending limits for cloud services, tools, and ongoing operational costs. Ask about hard budget caps.

## 3. Acceptable Tradeoffs
Record explicit tradeoff decisions (e.g., speed vs. features, cost vs. scalability). For each tradeoff, document the decision, accepted impact, and mitigation plan.

## 4. Non-Negotiable Requirements
List absolute requirements that cannot be compromised. Confirm these with the user before finalizing the plan.

## 5. Decision Log
Record significant decisions made during planning with rationale. Update as new constraints emerge.

## 6. Review Schedule
Establish when this document should be revisited. Set triggers for updates based on scope changes or new constraints.
